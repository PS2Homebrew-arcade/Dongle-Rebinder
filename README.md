A simple script that can batch rebind the `boot.bin` from security dongle virtual images, to be used on SD2PSX/MemCardPro

3. done! the dongle images have been rebound. Just in case... if you did not disable it... the script will make backups of each dongle before redinging, you can find them on `dongles_backup/` folder
